We need to modify the enhancement prompts to prevent the Gemini API from adding extra commentary or explanations to the enhanced prompt. The response should only contain the rewritten prompt itself.

Add Instruction to Suppress Commentary: Add the following instruction (or a variation of it) to the end of all enhancement prompts: Do not include any commentary such as original prompt, or enhanced prompt, just return the enhanced prompt only. Experiment with different phrasing if needed to find what works best.
Update Existing Prompts: Go through all existing enhancement prompts (for domains, agents, roles, methodologies) and add this new instruction to each of them.
Modify Prompt Composition Logic: Ensure that the instruction to suppress commentary is always included at the end of the composed prompt that's sent to the Gemini API.
Update Composed Enhancement Prompt Display: Update the composed enhancement prompt to display the instruction to suppress commentary.
Update Enhancement Instructions: Update the enhancement instructions to include instructions for each option added to prevent extra commentary.
By adding this instruction, we're explicitly telling the API to return only the enhanced prompt without any additional text."

Example of a Modified Prompt (for the "Code" domain):

Before:

This prompt is for a code-related task. Focus on code correctness, efficiency, and best practices.

After:

This prompt is for a code-related task. Focus on code correctness, efficiency, and best practices. Do not include any commentary such as original prompt, or enhanced prompt, just return the enhanced prompt only.

Important Considerations:

Experimentation: It might take some experimentation to find the phrasing that works consistently well with the Gemini API.
Model Updates: Keep in mind that API models can change, so you might need to adjust the instructions in the future.
By implementing these changes, you should be able to eliminate the unwanted commentary and get clean, usable enhanced prompts from the Gemini API.
