You're absolutely right.  My apologies for the oversight. Removing the "Agent Enhanced" concept was a mistake, as it's crucial to distinguish between a general-purpose prompt and one specifically tailored for an agent, even if they use the same underlying model.

Let's correct this by re-introducing the "Agent Enhanced" checkbox and refining how it works with the provider and model selections.

Here's a revised plan and prompt for the Replit agent:

**1. Re-Introduce "Agent Enhanced" Checkbox:**

*   Add the "Agent Enhanced" checkbox back into the "Edit Template" section.

**2. Refine "Agent Enhanced" Logic:**

*   **If "Agent Enhanced" is checked:**
    *   Display a new dropdown for "Agent Type" directly below the checkbox. This dropdown will list the available agents (e.g., "Cursor," "Replit," "Browser Agent").
    *   The "Model" dropdown should display models appropriate for the selected agent if applicable, otherwise it should display all models.
*   **If "Agent Enhanced" is unchecked:**
    *   Hide the "Agent Type" dropdown.
    *   The "Model" dropdown should display all available language models.

**3. Update Enhancement Prompts:**

*   Keep the `agents` section in `defaultPrompts` to store agent-specific enhancement instructions.
*   When generating the enhancement prompt:
    *   If "Agent Enhanced" is checked, include both the agent-specific instructions (from the `agents` section) and the model-specific instructions (from the `models` section).
    *   If "Agent Enhanced" is unchecked, only include the model-specific instructions.

**4. Update Template List Labels:**

*   If a template is "Agent Enhanced," include an "Agent" tag/pill in the template list, along with the provider, model, and other relevant information.

**Prompt for Replit Agent:**

>         *   If 'Agent Enhanced' is unchecked, only include the model-specific instructions.
> 4.  **Update Template List Labels:**
>     *   If a template is 'Agent Enhanced', include an 'Agent' tag/pill in the template list, along with the provider, model, and other relevant information. Also include the specific agent in this tag (e.g., 'Agent: Cursor').
> 5.  **Update `Template` interface:**
>     *   Add `agentType` and `agentEnhanced` fields back into the `Template` interface.

>
> *   `[Code] [Agent] [Agent: Cursor] [OpenAI] [GPT-4-Turbo] [Developer] [TDD]`
> *   `[General] [Anthropic] [Claude Sonnet]`
>
> These changes will allow us to create prompts that are tailored for specific agents and models, or for general-purpose use, while providing a clear visual representation of these settings in the UI."

// ... rest of the code (generateEnhancementPrompt, etc.) ...
```

**Corrected `generateEnhancementPrompt` function:**

```typescript
export function generateEnhancementPrompt(
  template: Template,
  originalPrompt: string,
  customInstructions?: string
): string {
  const prompts = getCustomPrompts();

  const parts = [
    "Please improve the following prompt. Aim for clarity, conciseness, and effectiveness. Ensure the revised prompt is well-structured and achieves its intended purpose.",
    `Original Prompt: ${originalPrompt}`,
    prompts.domains[template.domain],
    template.agentEnhanced && template.agentType ? `This prompt will be used with ${template.agentType}. ${prompts.agents[template.agentType]}` : null,
    prompts.models[template.modelType],
    prompts.roles[template.roleType],
    ...template.methodologies.map(m => prompts.methodologies[m])
  ].filter(Boolean);

  const basePrompt = parts.join(' ');

  let finalPrompt = basePrompt;

  if (customInstructions) {
    finalPrompt += ` ${customInstructions}`;
  }

  // Add instruction to prevent commentary and formatting
  finalPrompt += ' IMPORTANT: Return only the enhanced prompt. Exclude any headers, labels, formatting, or commentary.';

  return finalPrompt;
}
```

By making these adjustments, we'll have a system that correctly distinguishes between agent-specific and general-purpose prompts while retaining the flexibility to choose different models and enhancement options. The UI will also be clearer and more informative. Remember to test thoroughly after implementing these changes!
