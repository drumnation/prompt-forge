Okay, let's refine the categories, agent/model types, roles, methodologies, and default instructions based on your feedback and expand on some of these ideas.

**1. Initial Categories:**

*   **Code (Default):**  Since this is your primary use case, it makes sense to have "Code" as the default category.
*   **General:**  A catch-all for prompts not related to code.
*   **Marketing:**  For prompts related to advertising, copywriting, social media, etc.
*   **Education:** For prompts related to lesson planning, creating educational content, etc.
*   **Creative Writing:** For prompts related to writing stories, poems, scripts, etc.

**Prompt for Replit Agent:**

> "Let's set the default 'Domain' to 'Code' since that's my primary use case. We should also include 'General', 'Marketing', 'Education', and 'Creative Writing' as options in the 'Domain' dropdown."

**2. Agent/Model Types:**

You're right, we should include a wider range of agents and models. Here's a more comprehensive list:

*   **Agents:**
    *   **Cursor:** Optimized for code editing within an IDE.
    *   **Replit:**  Optimized for working within the Replit environment.
    *   **Claude:** (We can group different versions of Claude under this)
    *   **DeepSeek:**
    *   **Browser Agent:** A general category for agents that interact with web browsers (e.g., for testing or automation). We can refine this further if needed.
*   **Models:**
    *   **GPT-4:**
    *   **Gemini:** (We can group different versions of Gemini under this)
    *   **General:** For cases where the model isn't specified or the enhancement should be model-agnostic.

**Prompt for Replit Agent:**

> "For the 'Agent' input, let's expand the options to include: 'Cursor', 'Replit', 'Claude', 'DeepSeek', and 'Browser Agent'. We should also have a 'Model' input with options for: 'GPT-4', 'Gemini', and 'General'."

**3. Role Types:**

"Architect," "Developer," and "Tester" are a good starting point. We might add more specialized roles later if needed, but these are sufficient for now.

**Prompt for Replit Agent:**

> "For the 'Role' dropdown, let's keep the options as 'Architect', 'Developer', and 'Tester' for now. We can add more specialized roles later if needed."

**4. Methodologies/Practices:**

This is where we can get more specific about coding practices. Here are some ideas, including your suggestion of "Atomic Design":

*   **TDD (Test-Driven Development):** Emphasize writing tests before code.
*   **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development):** Focus on user stories and acceptance criteria.
*   **Refactoring:** Improve code structure and maintainability.
    *   **Atomic Design:** (As a subset of Refactoring) Focus on breaking down UI into reusable components.
    *   **SOLID Principles:** (As a subset of Refactoring) Emphasize principles like Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.
    *   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** (As a subset of Refactoring) Focus on reducing code duplication.
*   **Code Review:** Optimize the prompt for providing feedback on code.

**Prompt for Replit Agent:**

> "For the 'Methodology' checkboxes, let's include: 'TDD', 'BDD', and 'Refactoring'. Under 'Refactoring', we can add further options as checkboxes: 'Atomic Design', 'SOLID Principles', and 'DRY'. We should also have a checkbox for 'Code Review'."

**5. Default Instructions:**

This is crucial for making the system effective. Here are some ideas for default instructions, but these will likely need to be refined through experimentation:

**Domain:**

*   **Code:** "This prompt is for a code-related task. Focus on code correctness, efficiency, and best practices."
*   **General:** "This prompt is for a general-purpose task. Focus on clarity, conciseness, and relevance to the given context."
*   **Marketing:** "This prompt is for a marketing-related task. Focus on persuasiveness, clarity, and engagement. Tailor the message to the target audience and the specific marketing channel."
*   **Education:**  "This prompt is for an educational context. Focus on clarity, accuracy, and pedagogical effectiveness. Consider the age and knowledge level of the learners."
*   **Creative Writing:** "This prompt is for creative writing. Focus on originality, vivid language, and engaging storytelling."

**Agent/Model:**

*   **Cursor:** "This prompt will be used with Cursor. Optimize the prompt for code editing and generation within an IDE environment. Assume the agent has access to the entire codebase."
*   **Replit:** "This prompt will be used with Replit. Optimize the prompt for code editing and generation within the Replit online environment."
*   **Claude:** "This prompt will be used with Claude. Leverage Claude's strengths in conversational AI and natural language understanding."
*   **DeepSeek:** "This prompt will be used with DeepSeek. Leverage DeepSeek's strengths in code understanding, generation, and complex reasoning."
*   **Browser Agent:** "This prompt will be used with a browser agent. Optimize the prompt for tasks that involve interacting with web pages, such as web automation or testing. The agent can navigate, click elements, fill forms, and extract information from web pages."
*   **GPT-4:** "This prompt will be used with GPT-4. Leverage GPT-4's strengths in general-purpose language understanding and generation."
*   **Gemini:** "This prompt will be used with Gemini. Leverage Gemini's strengths in reasoning, problem-solving, and code generation."
*   **General:** "This prompt will be used with a general-purpose language model. Make the instructions clear and unambiguous."

**Role:**

*   **Architect:** "This prompt is for a software architect. Focus on high-level design, system architecture, and technical decision-making. Consider scalability, maintainability, and security."
*   **Developer:** "This prompt is for a software developer. Focus on implementation details, code structure, algorithms, and data structures. Emphasize code correctness and efficiency."
*   **Tester:** "This prompt is for a software tester. Focus on identifying potential bugs, edge cases, and areas for improvement in code quality. Consider different testing methodologies, such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing."

**Methodology:**

*   **TDD:** "Emphasize the importance of writing tests *before* implementing code. Encourage the use of unit tests to drive development and ensure code correctness."
*   **BDD:** "Focus on defining behavior from the user's perspective. Encourage the use of user stories and acceptance criteria to guide development."
*   **Refactoring:** "This prompt is for refactoring existing code. Emphasize improving code structure, readability, and maintainability without changing its external behavior."
    *   **Atomic Design:** "Focus on breaking down the UI into small, reusable components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)."
    *   **SOLID Principles:** "Adhere to the SOLID principles of object-oriented design: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion."
    *   **DRY:** "Eliminate code duplication by identifying and abstracting common patterns into reusable components or functions."
*   **Code Review:** "This prompt is for a code review. Focus on providing constructive feedback on code quality, identifying potential bugs or areas for improvement, and suggesting alternative solutions. Be specific and provide examples where possible."

**Prompt for the Replit Agent:**

> "Let's define some default enhancement instructions for each category, agent/model, role, and methodology. Here are some initial ideas:
>
> \[Insert the instructions outlined above for each category, agent/model, role, and methodology]
>
> We can refine these instructions further as we experiment with the system. The key is to have a starting point for each option that will guide the Gemini API in a meaningful way."

By implementing these refinements and defining the default instructions, you'll create a powerful and flexible system for enhancing prompts based on their specific context. Remember that the best instructions will likely emerge through experimentation and iteration, so be prepared to adjust them as you use the system and observe the results.
