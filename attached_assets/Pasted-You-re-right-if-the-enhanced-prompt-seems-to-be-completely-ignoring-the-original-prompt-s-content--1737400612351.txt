You're right, if the enhanced prompt seems to be completely ignoring the original prompt's content, it's highly likely that the original prompt isn't being included in the final prompt sent to the Gemini API. Let's focus on ensuring the original prompt is correctly incorporated into the `generateEnhancementPrompt` function.

**Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Verify `originalPrompt` in `generateEnhancementPrompt`:**
    *   Add `console.log` statements to `generateEnhancementPrompt` to check the value of `originalPrompt` and other variables.

2.  **Inspect Prompt Composition:**
    *   Carefully review how the final prompt is being assembled in `generateEnhancementPrompt`. Make sure the `originalPrompt` is being correctly concatenated with the other parts.

3.  **Check for Overwrites:**
    *   Make sure that no part of the code is accidentally overwriting or modifying the `finalPrompt` after the `originalPrompt` has been added.

>
> 1.  **Add Logging:**
>     *   Add `console.log('originalPrompt:', originalPrompt)` at the beginning of the `generateEnhancementPrompt` function to verify that the function is receiving the original prompt correctly.
>     *   Add `console.log('finalPrompt:', finalPrompt)` right before the `return finalPrompt` statement to inspect the full prompt being returned.
> 2.  **Review Prompt Composition:**
>     *   Carefully review the logic in `generateEnhancementPrompt` where the `parts` array is created and joined to form the `basePrompt`.
>     *   Make sure that the `originalPrompt` is correctly included in the `parts` array. It should be inserted in a way that makes sense in the context of the overall prompt. For example, you might want to add a line like: `"The prompt to enhance is: " + originalPrompt`
>     *   Make sure the `basePrompt` is then correctly assigned to the `finalPrompt`, and that no subsequent code overwrites `finalPrompt` unintentionally.
> 3.  **Share Code:**
>     *   Please share the current code of the `generateEnhancementPrompt` function.
>     *   Share the code where you are calling the `generateEnhancementPrompt` function. I need to see how you are passing the `originalPrompt` to it.
>
> After making these changes, trigger an enhancement and show me the console output. We need to see the values of `originalPrompt` and `finalPrompt` to diagnose the issue."

**Example Code Snippets (Illustrative):**

```typescript
// In generateEnhancementPrompt:

export function generateEnhancementPrompt(
  template: Template,
  originalPrompt: string,
  customInstructions?: string
): string {
  console.log('originalPrompt:', originalPrompt); // Log the original prompt

  // ... (rest of your prompt composition logic) ...

  console.log('finalPrompt:', finalPrompt); // Log the final prompt
  return finalPrompt;
}
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

*   **Step-by-Step Debugging:** Use `console.log` to trace the flow of execution and the values of variables at each step.
*   **Isolate the Problem:** Try to isolate the problem to a specific part of the `generateEnhancementPrompt` function. Is the `originalPrompt` being passed in correctly? Is it being added to the `parts` array? Is it being overwritten somewhere?
*   **Simplify:** If the logic is complex, try temporarily simplifying it to make it easier to debug. For example, you could hardcode a simple prompt and see if that gets included correctly.

By carefully inspecting the logs and reviewing the code, you and the Replit agent should be able to pinpoint where the `originalPrompt` is being dropped and fix the issue. Remember to provide the agent with the console output and relevant code snippets to help it diagnose the problem quickly.
