Your prompt will be processed by a meta-model and routed to one of dozens of models (see below), optimizing for the best possible output.

To see which model was used, visit Activity, or read the model attribute of the response. Your response will be priced at the same rate as the routed model.

The meta-model is powered by Not Diamond. Learn more in our docs.
