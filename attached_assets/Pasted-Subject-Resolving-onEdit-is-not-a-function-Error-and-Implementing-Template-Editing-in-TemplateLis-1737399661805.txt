Subject: Resolving "onEdit is not a function" Error and Implementing Template Editing in TemplateList.tsx

We have a persistent error in TemplateList.tsx around line 105: [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] onEdit is not a function. This occurs when clicking the edit pencil icon associated with each template in the list. Additionally, selecting a template should populate the "Edit Template" section fields for editing, but it currently does not.

Objective: Fix the onEdit is not a function error and implement the template editing functionality.

Error Details:

Error Message: [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] onEdit is not a function

Location: TemplateList.tsx:105:25

Context: The error occurs within the onClick handler of the edit button/icon for each template.

The code at the error location is:

TypeScript

103|                        onClick={(e) => {
104|                          e.stopPropagation();
105|                          onEdit(template);
   |                          ^
106|                        }}
107|                        title="Edit template"
Debugging Steps (Already Attempted):

We have tried verifying that onEdit is defined.
We have tried checking for typos in the function name.
We have tried investigating the scope of onEdit.
We have tried checking for conditional rendering issues.
We have tried adding logging to debug.
Current Behavior:

Clicking the edit icon throws the onEdit is not a function error.
Selecting a template does not populate the "Edit Template" section fields.
Expected Behavior:

Clicking the edit icon should not throw any errors. It should call the onEdit function, passing the selected template object as an argument.
Selecting a template (by clicking on it anywhere other than the edit button) should populate the "Edit Template" section fields with the selected template's data (name, content, domain, agent settings, etc.). The "Agent Enhanced" checkbox should be checked if the selected template has agent settings, and the "Agent Type" dropdown should become visible and set to the proper agent.
Code Snippets (Relevant):

Please provide the following code snippets:

TemplateList.tsx: The entire code of the TemplateList component.
Parent Component: The code of the component that renders TemplateList, focusing on how onEdit is passed as a prop.
onEdit Function: The code of the onEdit function itself (wherever it's defined).
State Management: The code that manages the state of the "Edit Template" section (how the selected template data is stored and updated).
Specific Tasks:

Diagnose onEdit Error:
Carefully examine the provided code snippets to determine why onEdit is not a function at the point of the error.
Consider possibilities like incorrect scoping, onEdit not being passed down correctly as a prop, or onEdit being overwritten or undefined somewhere else in the code.
Use console.log() statements liberally to trace the value and type of onEdit at various points in the code, especially right before it's called on line 105.
If onEdit is defined within a class component, ensure it's properly bound to the component instance using either an arrow function or .bind(this) in the constructor.
Implement Template Editing:
Ensure that the onEdit function, when called, receives the correct template object as an argument.
Inside onEdit, update the state of the "Edit Template" section with the data from the selected template. This should automatically populate the input fields.
When the edit icon is clicked, the form should switch to edit mode, and the "Update Template" button should become enabled. The "Create Template" button should be hidden at this time.
When "Update Template" is clicked, the changes should be saved to the database, the template list should refresh, the form should reset to its default state, the "Create Template" button should be visible, and the "Update Template" button should be disabled.
Handle Template Selection:
Implement the functionality to populate the "Edit Template" section fields when a template is selected (not just when the edit icon is clicked). The "Edit Template" section should populate with the selected template's data, but it should not switch to edit mode until the edit icon is clicked. The "Create Template" button should still be visible, but the "Update Template" button should be disabled.
Additional Notes:

We are using React with TypeScript.
We are using functional components and hooks.
The error suggests that onEdit is either undefined or not a function at the time of the click event.
Please provide a detailed explanation of the solution, including the corrected code and any necessary changes to the component structure or state management.

Focus on providing a solution that addresses the root cause of the error and implements the correct template editing behavior.
